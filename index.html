    Tried to keep the html as clean as possible, and use CSS for nearly every modifier of the base element

                            Continue to adapt, learn, <strong>never settle</strong> for what you already know - there's
                            plenty of opportunities out there to continue to build and enhance your skillsets. In this
                            case, I'm taking this course to learn nodeJS and build upon a foundation that hasn't been
                            touched since college with frontend development. Even some of the more basic functionality
                            has been upgraded heavily since my initial deep dive (HTML5 & CSS3 Primarily). Seeing how
                            far these technologies have advanced, primarily with ease of use, is fascinating.

                            I'm building that on top of a strong foundation in:
